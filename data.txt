ABSTRACT
Travel booking behaviour has changed substantially over the past two decades. The emergence of new technology and online intermediaries has provided travellers with the flexibility to book up until the date of stay. This has created a fast-paced, dynamic booking environment that disrupts traditional revenue management strategies focused on pricing and allocating rooms based on the time of purchase. The study explores the joint effects of technology and the economy on booking window lead times. It also evaluates a range of forecasting techniques and the importance of utilizing the booking curve for forecasting in dynamic booking environments.
It discusses how the traditional approach of utilizing travel agents and booking ahead has evolved into a fast-paced, last-minute booking environment, affecting revenue management in areas such as forecasting, pricing, and online travel agency inventory allocations.

Project Overview 
 Create a software application that automates the process of reserving travel-related services. It integrates multiple services and features to create a unified platform for users to plan their trips.
Database Normalization 
Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like insertion, update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rule divides larger tables into smaller tables and link them using relationships. The purpose of Normalization is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.
 
Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
A data flow diagram is graphical tool used to describe and analyze movement of data through a system. These are the central tool and the basis from which the other components are developed. The transformation of data from input to output, through processed, may be described logically and independently of physical components associated with the system. These are known as the logical data flow diagrams. The physical data flow diagrams show the actual implements and movement of data between people, departments and workstations.
DFD Level 0
 

DFD Level 1
 

ER Diagram
The relation upon the system is structure through a conceptual ER-Diagram, which not only specifics the existential entities but also the standard relations through which the system exists and the cardinalities that are necessary for the system state to continue.

MOTIVATION  
The motivation behind implementing a Blissful Journey is manifold:
1.	Content Consumption: Travelers now consume more content than ever before. Recommendations from family and friends remain a top spark for trip planning, but social media plays a significant role, with 77% of travellers seeking inspiration there.
2.	Efficiency: Implementing an online booking system increases efficiency by automating the booking process, reducing the risk of double bookings or errors.
3.	New Discoveries: Travellers have diverse reasons for booking trips, such as discovering new places, trying new food, or escaping from daily demands. Understanding these motives helps businesses tailor their offerings to meet travellers’ needs.
4.	Data Utilization: Technology allows the industry to anticipate and predict traveller preferences through big data analytics and machine learning.
5.	Transparency on fees and charges: Clearly display any additional fees (such as baggage fees, taxes, or service charges) during the booking process. Transparency builds trust and helps users make informed decision.
6.	Responsive Design: Travellers expect a consistent experience regardless of the platform they use so that it will ensure booking system works seamlessly across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).










LITERATURE REVIEW

A literature review on the Blissful Journey reveals several key aspects:
1.	Security and Trust in Online Booking Systems: Conducting an extensive review of relevant literature, this study analyses online booking systems, e-commerce security, and trust-building strategies .Researchers identify key factors influencing security and trust in online travel bookings[1].
2.	Hotel Booking Intentions: This comprehensive review covers hotel booking intentions, including variables that influence overall satisfaction (both online and offline).The study examines research published in recognized tourism and hospitality journals from 2000 to 2003[2].
3.	A Meta-Analysis of Online Travel Booking Services Adoption: Investigating the adoption of online travel booking services, this study explores path relationships and moderating effects based on economic development levels and cultural differences[3].
4.	The Evolution of Online Booking Systems: Online booking systems have automated internal reservation processes for touristic suppliers and enabled self-service booking for travellers globally[4].
5.	Flask of python: Flask is a web framework that allows developers to build lightweight web applications quickly and easily with Flask Libraries. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, leader of the International Group of Python Enthusiasts (POCCO). It is basically based on the WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine[5].
6.	HTML with CSS: CSS is used to apply the style in the web page which is made up of HTML elements. It describes the look of the webpage.CSS provides various style properties such as background colour, padding, margin, border-colour, and many more, to style a webpage. Each property in CSS has a name-value pair, and each property is separated by a semicolon (;) [6].
